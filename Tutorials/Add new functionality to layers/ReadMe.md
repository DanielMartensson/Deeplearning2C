In this tutorial, I show you how to add a new functionality to layers.

Step 1: Add your array list

Step 2: Add a getter here

Step 3: Add the functionality to the layers here

Step 4: Add an adder to the array list

Step 5: Add a clear function to the array list

Step 6: Add argument for basic intial model when we start a new model

Step 7: Add field for the table

Step 8: Add a @FXML field that are connected to a .fxml file

Step 9: Connect the column to the field

Step 10: Getter when we reload our table

Step 11: Here we insert values to our drop down button for dropOutPropabilityList

Step 12: And add it to the observable list

Step 13: Add this array list here. We going to return it to the original array list in another class

Step 14: Add functionality to get the selected drop out value

Step 15: Collect all drop outs

Step 16: Return it back to the original array list in another class

Step 17: Here we just add possible values for drop out

Step 18: And we store everything inside the observable list

Step 19: Open up Scene Builder 8 and add a column. Don't forget to set the ID to the column to! Look to the right.

Step 20: We need to change this to 161 because else we will get a waring in the console
