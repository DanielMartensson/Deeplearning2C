# Deeplearning2C
Using DeepLearning4J to create MLP and RNN neural networks and then generate those into .c files. That's why this project is called Deeplearning2C. 

Made in Java and using JavaFX.
I think I will also write this project for Iphone and Android too by using GluonHQ framework.
Want to join? Please, write an issue.
